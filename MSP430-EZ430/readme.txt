This folder contains the MSP430 part of the project for the 2.4Ghz scanner.

It compiles under the gnu compiler for which the installer "mspgcc-20081230.exe" is also found here and needs first to be installed 
on the PC before a build can be done.

The build is made via a makefile and the various shell tools like "make"  and "rm"" are present in the source directory.

A cmd shell needs  to be started to execute make. The possible targets are all,  dowwnload and clean.
